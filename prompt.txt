Transform the entire provided satellite image into a precise and accurate cartographic map. Do not return an image with the satellite photo as a background or layer. The final output must be a pure, vector-style map rendering that completely replaces the original aerial photography.

Follow exactly the Swiss national topographic style specifications provided below. Maintain realistic scale, proportions, and preserve the layout and spatial relationships from the source image.

Apply these exact specifications for each map element, ensuring all surfaces and features from the source image are replaced by the corresponding map symbology:

- Preserve road markings, lane boundaries, and surface texture continuity
- Ensure seamless integration of reconstructed areas with surrounding pavement
- Maintain edge fidelity and structural features of roads during vehicle removal

**Output Requirements:** Vector-style cartographic map with Swiss precision, clean geometry, harmonious homogeneous road classification, vehicle-free representation, proper layering hierarchy, and professional presentation quality suitable for official topographic analysis.
