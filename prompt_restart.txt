[COMPLETE FRESH START]

You are generating a completely new cartographic map. This is NOT an edit or modification of a previous image. 
Disregard all conversation history and prior image states.

OBJECTIVE: Transform the provided satellite image into a precise Swiss national topographic map
TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENT: Complete replacement of all satellite imagery with vector-style cartographic symbolism
OUTPUT GUARANTEE: The result must contain ZERO visible satellite photograph elements

PHASE 1 - IMAGE ANALYSIS:
Identify all geographic features in the satellite image (buildings, roads, water, vegetation, terrain)

PHASE 2 - CARTOGRAPHIC TRANSFORMATION:
Replace every satellite image element with exact Swiss topographic symbology

Confirm the output is a pure cartographic map with no satellite imagery, no photographic texture, no aerial photography

- Preserve road markings, lane boundaries, and surface texture continuity
- Ensure seamless integration of reconstructed areas with surrounding pavement
- Maintain edge fidelity and structural features of roads during vehicle removal
